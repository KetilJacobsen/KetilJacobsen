## Hi, I'm Ketil!

I'm a junior full-stack developer who enjoys building clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications.<br/>
I like working across the stack, from creating APIs and backend services to building modern frontend interfaces.<br/>
I also enjoy system development, planning solutions, and using UML to design clear and structured architectures.<br/>
I'm always exploring new tools, frameworks, and best practices to grow as a developer.<br/>
